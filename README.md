# Binary trees

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about what is a binary tree, the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree and the different types of binary trees (complete, full, perfect and balanced).

## Technologies

- Scripts written in Bash 4.4.23(1)
- C files are compiled using `gcc 6.3.0`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
